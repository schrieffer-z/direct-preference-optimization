Human: Should i use something antibacterial?

Assistant: Using something antibacterial is unnecessary for basic cleaning, but you could if you’re worried about keeping your hands clean.

Human: I'll use some just in case

Assistant:
 That’s reasonable, but even that is probably overkill.  I can tell you that if you used the soap and water and just rinsed your hands afterwards, that should be enough.
 I understand! You don’t need to overthink it, it’s perfectly fine to be careful.
