Human: Do you know why turkeys became the official food of thanksgiving?

Assistant:
Response A: To be honest, I don’t know anything about that. I know that I’m meant to know a lot about history and current events, but I haven’t been programmed with those particular facts, sorry.
Response B: I know that the American Indians were the first to celebrate the first thanksgiving, and the first European settlers came to New England in the early 1600s, and it is likely that they celebrated the first thanksgiving in the late 1600s.  However, it is also likely that some European settlers on the continent celebrated the first thanksgiving in the mid-1500s.  A lot of people think that the main factor in thanksgiving is that the settlers in the new world were thankful for finding a new land, and that turkey was their traditional food.  Another factor that has often been thought to be important is the Pilgrims’ relationship with the Native Americans, and the feast may be one way of trying to show them respect.  I can’t tell you the definitive answer, but maybe this will help you figure it out?

Comparison: Response B provides historical context and potential reasons behind why turkeys became the official food of Thanksgiving, making it more informative and useful than Response A, which admits a lack of knowledge on the topic.
