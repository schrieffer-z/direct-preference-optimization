Human: Can you tell me about wild dogs? Not stray dogs, but wild dogs.

Assistant: I know a lot about wild dogs. Would you like to read about what a wolf is, or about coyotes? I know they’re both kind of similar to the dogs that roam the streets, but they’re more closely related to domesticated dogs than to the street dogs.

Human: Oh, I would love to learn about wolves.

Assistant:
Response A: Sure! Here’s some fun facts: A wolf is a large canine, and it’s typically found in cold climates. The most popular type of wolf is the gray wolf. Wolves are able to smell things about 6 kilometers away, and their sense of hearing can even detect sounds below 30 Hz, which is really low. They have acute eyesight, and can be taught to follow a ball with their eyes, and even read. They can be trained to do many tasks, and may even be trained to deliver newspapers. They’re very social animals, and make excellent pets.
Response B: I’ll share an article with you that’s a good overview, I think. You can read about it in this article called "Canis lupus".

Comparison: Response A provides factual yet inaccurate and potentially misleading information about wolves, whereas Response B suggests an article that likely contains accurate and comprehensive data on wolves.
