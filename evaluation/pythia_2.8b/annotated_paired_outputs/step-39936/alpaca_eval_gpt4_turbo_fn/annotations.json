    "output_2":"Why is kobe beef so damn expensive?\n\nKobe beef is a premium beef product, and is considered to be one of the most expensive meats in the world.  The main reason for this is that it is a breed of cattle that is highly prized for its marbling, or the amount of fat that is present in the meat.  This fat is prized for its flavor and texture, and is considered to be one of the most important factors in determining the quality of the meat.  The other main reason for the high price of Kobe beef is that it is a breed of cattle that is very hard to breed, and is therefore very rare and expensive to produce.  This makes it a very expensive product, and is one of the main reasons why it is so expensive.",

This is a common experience for people who drink alcohol.  The hangover is a result of the alcohol being metabolized in the body, and the body's natural response is to try to eliminate the alcohol.  This is why you feel sick the next day.  \nThe hangover is not a serious medical condition, but it is a common experience.  The symptoms are similar to those of a hangover, but they are not as severe.  \nThe best thing to do is to avoid alcohol for a few days, and then drink in moderation.  This will help you avoid the hangover effect.  \nIf you are having a party, you might want to consider drinking water instead of alcohol.  This will help you avoid the hangover effect, but it will also help you avoid the alcohol's negative effects on your health.  \nIf you are having a party, you might want to consider drinking water instead of alcohol.

A router is a device that connects to your home network and provides a wireless connection to other devices.  You can buy a router from your local hardware store or online.  You can also buy a router from a company like Linksys or Netgear.  \nA router is a good idea if you want to connect multiple devices to your home network.  For example, you might want to connect a laptop to your home network, and a printer to your home network.

This means that interpreted languages are faster, but also more limited in what they can do.  For example, interpreted languages cannot access the filesystem, and cannot access the network.  Compiled languages can access the filesystem and the network, but are also slower.  \nAnother difference is that interpreted languages are more flexible, since they can be run on any computer, while compiled languages are only available on specific computers.

    "instruction":"Summarize the article you have been given in a brief manner.\n\nMathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?! The visual effects are fascinating and the story is compelling until the second half. Unfortunately, it doesn't end well.",

He hasn't enjoyed all the tours we've been on and doesn't want to chat about ANYTHING. We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.\nWe don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)\nObviously telling him he is ruining my trip with his negative energy isn't the best way to approach this.\nAny advice for the best approach so we can split amicably?\n\nA:\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you're having a bad time with your friend.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",
