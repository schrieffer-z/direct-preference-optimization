        "output": "How long does it take our eyes to fully adapt to darkness?\n\nThe human eye is a complex organ that is capable of adapting to darkness.  The eye is able to adapt to darkness by reducing the amount of light that reaches the retina.  This adaptation process is called \u201cdark adaptation\u201d.  The time it takes for the eye to fully adapt to darkness is called the \u201cdark adaptation time\u201d.  The dark adaptation time varies from person to person, but it is generally between 10 and 30 minutes.  The dark adaptation time is affected by many factors, including the amount of light that reaches the retina, the amount of light that is reflected from the retina, and the amount of light that is absorbed by the retina.  The dark adaptation time is also affected by the age of the eye.  The dark adaptation time is shorter for younger eyes, and longer for older eyes.  The dark adaptation time is also affected by the health of the eye.  The dark adaptation time is shorter for healthy eyes, and longer for eyes that are damaged or diseased.

But we can also see that there are many ways we can work together to prevent it, and to make sure that we have a safe and sustainable future for our planet.  So what should we do to stop climate change?  Here are some of the most important things we can do:\n\n1.  Reduce our carbon emissions.  We can do this by reducing the amount of carbon we produce, and by making sure that we use energy efficiently.  We can also reduce our carbon emissions by making sure that we use renewable energy sources, like wind and solar power.  And we can also reduce our carbon emissions by making sure that we use less energy-intensive products, like electric cars and appliances.  \n\n2.  Reduce our consumption of fossil fuels.  We can do this by making sure that we use less energy-intensive products, like electric cars and appliances.  We can also make sure that we use less energy-intensive products, like heating and cooling our homes.  And we can also make sure that we use less energy-intensive products, like lighting and electronics.  \n\n",

Can a single pane window be more efficient than a double pane window? If yes, what is needed for this? Support your answer with appropriate calculations.\n\nA:\n\nThe answer is yes, a double pane window can be more efficient than a triple pane window.

Twitch recommends 3000kbps upload speed in my streaming software, but how much extra headroom do I need so the twitch stream and online gameplay are both smooth?\n\nA:\n\nTwitch recommends 3000kbps upload speed in my streaming software, but how much extra headroom do I need so the twitch stream and online gameplay are both smooth?\n\nThe minimum recommended upload speed is 3000kbps, but you can get away with a bit more.  The reason for the recommendation is that Twitch wants to ensure that the stream is smooth and that the game is running smoothly.  If you're streaming at a lower speed, you'll notice some stuttering or lagging in the game.  If you're streaming at a higher speed, you'll notice some stuttering or lagging in the stream.  \nThe recommended upload speed is based on the average upload speed of the internet connection you're using.  If you're using a high-speed internet connection, you'll notice a lot less stuttering or lagging in the stream.  If you're using a low-speed internet connection, you'll notice more stuttering or lagging in the stream.  \nIf you're streaming at a lower speed, you'll notice some stuttering or lagging in the game.  If you're streaming at a higher speed, you'll notice some stuttering or lagging in the stream.  \n",

I have tried many recipes for apple muffins, but none of them are as good as the ones I have made myself. I have found that the key to a good apple muffin is to use fresh apples, and to make sure they are not too ripe. I also like to use a combination of spices, such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. I also like to use a little bit of sugar, and I like to add a little bit of vanilla extract. I like to make my muffins in a muffin pan, and I like to make them in a cast iron skillet.

Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set.

Give the exact sentences from the abstract that discuss the method.\n\nWe present a state-of-the-art speech recognition system developed using end-to-end deep learning. Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",

CRISPR is a bacterial immune system that uses RNA to identify and destroy invading viruses. The CRISPR system is composed of a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and a CRISPR-associated protein (Cas9). The CRISPR RNA is a small RNA that is transcribed from a CRISPR locus. The CRISPR locus is a region of DNA that is found in bacteria and archaea. The CRISPR locus contains a number of genes that encode the CRISPR RNA and Cas9. The CRISPR RNA is a small RNA that is transcribed from the CRISPR locus. The CRISPR RNA is a guide RNA that is used to identify and destroy invading viruses. The Cas9 protein is a protein that is encoded by the CRISPR locus.

The most common vaccines are for measles, mumps, rubella, and polio.  Vaccines are also used to protect against influenza, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, and hepatitis B.  Vaccines are also used to protect against some cancers, such as chickenpox, mumps, and measles.  Vaccines are also used to protect against some sexually transmitted diseases, such as HPV and HIV.\n\nVaccines are designed to protect individuals from infectious diseases by stimulating the body\u2019s immune system to produce antibodies that can fight off the disease.  The body\u2019s immune system is able to fight off infectious diseases because it is constantly exposed to them.

On the one hand, technological progress is a necessary condition for job creation.  If we want to create jobs, we need to invest in new technologies.  On the other hand, technological progress is not sufficient for job creation.  If we want to create jobs, we also need to invest in new businesses.  In other words, we need to prioritize job creation over technological progress.

In the short term, technological progress is more important.  In the long term, job creation is more important.  In the short term, technological progress is more important because it is more immediate.  In the long term, job creation is more important because it is more sustainable.
