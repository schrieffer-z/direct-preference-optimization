It is a mathematical formula that estimates the number of intelligent civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy, based on the following factors:\n\nThe fraction of stars in the galaxy that have planets.\nThe fraction of those planets that have life.\nThe fraction of those planets that have intelligent life.\nThe fraction of those intelligent life that are capable of interstellar travel.\nThe fraction of those intelligent life that are capable of interstellar travel to another galaxy.\nThe fraction of those intelligent life that are capable of interstellar travel to another galaxy and another galaxy.\nThe fraction of those intelligent life that are capable of interstellar travel to another galaxy and another galaxy and another galaxy.\nThe fraction of those intelligent life that are capable of interstellar travel to another galaxy and another galaxy and another galaxy and another galaxy.\nThe fraction of those intelligent life that are capable of interstellar travel to another galaxy and another galaxy and another galaxy and another galaxy and another galaxy.\nThe fraction of those intelligent life that are capable of interstellar travel to another galaxy and another galaxy and another galaxy and another",

Can anyone help?\n\nA:\n\nYou can use the formula for the square root of a sum:\n\nsqrt(sum(x_i^2)) = sqrt(sum(x_i^2/sum(x_i^2))) = sqrt(sum(x_i^2)/sum(x_i^2)) = sqrt(1/sum(x_i^2))\n\nSo you can just calculate the sum of the vector, and then divide by the sum of the squares of the vector.  This will give you the desired result.\n\n",

The number 3 is a prime factor of all numbers less than 231, so we can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the prime factors of n.  The Euclidean algorithm is a recursive algorithm that finds the prime factors of a number n by repeatedly dividing n by a smaller number until it is a power of 3.  The algorithm is as follows:\n\nLet a = n, b = 3, c = 1.\n\nIf a is a prime, then we are done.\n\nIf a is not a prime, then we have a = bc, where b is a divisor of a and c is a divisor of b.\n\nLet d = bc.\n\nIf d is a prime, then we are done.\n\nIf d is not a prime, then we have a = dq, where q is a divisor of d and c is a divisor of q.\n\nLet e = qc.\n\nIf e is a prime, then we are done.\n\nIf e is not a prime, then we have a = eq, where q is a divisor of e and c is a divisor of q.\n\nLet f = e",

Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",
