Betelgeuse is the brightest star in the constellation Orion, and is also the brightest star in the constellation Taurus.  Betelgeuse is a red supergiant, meaning it is a massive star that has exhausted its nuclear fuel and is now expanding into a red giant.  The red giant phase of Betelgeuse is expected to last for about 10 million years.  Betelgeuse is also a variable star, meaning it varies in brightness over time.  The brightness of Betelgeuse varies by about 0.5 magnitudes, or about a factor of 100.  The brightness of Betelgeuse is also affected by the Earth's orbit around the Sun, which causes the Earth to pass in front of Betelgeuse.  This causes the star to dim slightly, and also causes the star to appear to be slightly brighter when the Earth is behind it.  The brightness of Betelgeuse also varies over time, and is expected to vary by about 0.5 magnitudes over the next 10 million years.",

The relevant portion is:\n\n(a) A person is guilty of indecent exposure if he or she exposes his or her genitals, pubic area, buttocks or female breasts with intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of himself or herself or of any other person.\n\nThe statute does not define \"public nudity\", but it is clear that the legislature intended to prohibit public nudity.  The Wyoming Supreme Court has held that the statute is constitutional.  See State v. Hickman, 919 P.2d 811 (Wyo. 1996).  The court held that the statute is not unconstitutionally vague, and that it is not overbroad.  The court also held that the statute is not unconstitutional as applied to the defendant.  The court held that the statute is not overbroad because it does not prohibit all public nudity, but only public nudity that is intended to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of the defendant or another person.

In order to ensure the success of a project, it's important to involve all of the stakeholders in the project, and to work with them to ensure that the project is successful.  For example, in one project I worked on, we had to develop a new software system for a large company.  The project involved multiple teams, including a software development team, a business analysis team, and a project management team.  We worked with the business analysis team to ensure that the project was successful, and we worked with the project management team to ensure that the project was completed on time.  We also worked with the software development team to ensure that the software system was developed in a way that was efficient and effective.  Overall, the project was a success, and we were able to deliver a new software system for the company.",

Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim.

Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.Collapse",

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",

The basic idea is that quantum mechanics allows for the superposition of states, which means that a quantum system can be in multiple states at the same time.  This is in contrast to classical computers, which can only be in one state at a time.  This means that quantum computers can solve problems that are intractable using conventional computers, and also that they can be used to solve problems that are intractable using conventional computers.  \nThe first quantum computers were built in the 1990s, and they are now being built and tested.  The first quantum computers are very large, and they are also very expensive.  However, they are still in the early stages of development, and they are still being improved.  \nThe first quantum computers are based on the quantum mechanics of atoms, and they are called quantum computers because they use quantum mechanics to solve problems.

We learn from observing others, and we also learn from observing ourselves.  \nFor example, if you observe a group of people, and they are all behaving in a certain way, then you can infer that this is the way that the group of people is behaving.  \nSimilarly, if you observe a group of people behaving in a certain way, and you are also behaving in a certain way, then you can infer that you are also behaving in a certain way.  \nSo, if you observe a group of people behaving in a certain way, and you are also behaving in a certain way, then you can infer that the group of people is behaving in a certain way, and you are also behaving in a certain way.  \nSo, if you observe a group of people behaving in a certain way, and you are also observing a group of people behaving in a certain way, then you can infer that the group of people is behaving in a certain way, and you are also behaving in a",
