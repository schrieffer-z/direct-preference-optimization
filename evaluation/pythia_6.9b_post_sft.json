The solar wind is a stream of charged particles that are constantly being ejected from the Sun. The solar wind is composed of electrons, protons, and other subatomic particles. The solar wind is constantly being accelerated by the Sun\u2019s magnetic field, and it is also constantly being deflected by the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. The solar wind is deflected by the Earth\u2019s magnetic field in a way that causes it to collide with the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The collision of the solar wind with the Earth\u2019s atmosphere causes the solar wind to heat up and become ionized. The ionized solar wind is then deflected by the Earth\u2019s magnetic field in a way that causes it to collide with the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The collision of the ionized solar wind with the Earth\u2019s atmosphere causes the ionized solar wind to glow in the night sky. The glow of the ionized solar wind is called the aurora borealis.

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end.

Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?!

In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",

This is because the behavior of other people in a social situation is a reflection of the cultural norms and expectations of the people in that situation.  \nFor example, if you observe that a group of people are laughing and talking together, you can infer that they are having a good time, and that they are likely to be having a good time in the future.  If you observe that a group of people are sitting quietly and not talking to each other, you can infer that they are likely to be having a bad time, and that they are likely to be having a bad time in the future.  \nSimilarly, if you observe that a group of people are laughing and talking together, you can infer that they are likely to be having a good time, and that they are likely to be having a good time in the future.  If you observe that a group of people are sitting quietly and not talking to each other, you can infer that they are likely to be having a bad time, and that they are likely to be having a bad time in the future.  \nThe same is true for other behaviors.
